There are improvements currently being made to the program:

a) A function to manipulate the pages list was necessary. The function already exists and works fine; firstly, it allows the user
to append new values to the pages list and thus add extra web sites to scrap. Now this simply means more puppies; in the 
future, it may mean another virtual library to download .mobi books from, or an extra film page to download movies from.
And, what's most important, one that the user desires (and not that the programer imposed). Secondly, it allows to remove values
from the list. This results in a totally customizable websites-list for the user to create and to download from.

  Why isn't this function in the repository script? Because I yet didn't develop a method that stores the appended values
so the program can load them each time it runs. The values are appended on each run, but never stored. The program can't
remember them the next time. This shouldn't take long and will be included soon.

b) A poor, yet functioning menu is not hard to make. Simple string output and input to choose at the beginning to either start
the program or go to configuration (configuration equals the a) point: the method to manipulate the pages list).

c) A trial for formats that aren't .jpg or images. The new formats are yet to define; some minor and some considerable changes
are to be done to the script to adapt it.

There more improvements in order, but this are those that are currently being made.
