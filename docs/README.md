### Who doesn't love puppies?

#  What is it?

_**A super cool image downloader.**_

It has never been so easy to create, to manage, to furnish virtual galeries
of images. Of pictures. Of beauty.


# How does it work?

An amazing environment system allows you to create and manage multiple galeries
in a simple, efficient way, and furnish them with infinite pictures before an
eyelid's blink! Feed your environments with websites' links on the websites' file
each of them have; run PuppyAdopter and each environment will download images from
their websites. Feed your environments with as many websitse as you want; create as
many environments as you wish. The sky is the limit!

# Detailed instructions 

#### Environment Setting:

The **Environmentor** _manages our environments_. With it we can create or erase
environments. (The first time that you run **Environmentor** it will shut down after
apparently doing nothing. This is normal; it is doing useful things. After
this first time, it'll have regular behaviour.)

###### Creating an environment

If we choose to create an environment, we will be prompt to name its folders
and files. We can choose not to name them by simply typing anyting, which will
provide the files and folders with their default names.

Every environment has the following components:

a) an images folder, where the downloaded images of this environment will be stored;
b) a data file, which keeps track of the environment's data, and
c) a websites' list file, which is a simple .txt file where we are to paste the
links of the websites we want our environment to download images from.

You are to provide the websites' list with links to the websites you'd like
this environment to download images from. If this file is empty, no images will be
downloaded. _It is important that we paste the links on the websites' list one
per line!_

Once we have created our environment with Environmentor and provided its
website's list file with links, we can say our environment is settled! Now
it's time to adopt some puppies! Or download our images, rather...

###### Cleaning our data

If we choose to clear our environments, all our environments' data will be
erased and PuppyAdopter will no longer recognize the environments we created
before the clearing-process. If you clear your environments, none of them
will work anymore.

#### Puppy-Adopting Process:

If all your environments were provided with websites on the way explained before,
it's time to download! To do so, simple execute PuppyAdopter. It will automatically
do the job for you. Once it's done, your environments should be furnished with
images from their own websites, now downloaded to your computer!

# Quick instructions

**1.1** Run **Environmentor**. It will shut down the first time; this is normal.
Run it again to create an environment; name the folders and files as
you wish.

**1.2** On the step 1.1 you were prompted to name a websites' list: this created a file
with that name. Find the file on your environment and paste in it the
links of the websites you want this environment to download images from. Remember
to paste one link per line!

**1.3** Repeat the process until you have as many environments as you want.

**2.1** Downloading time! Simply run PuppyAdopter and he will download images from
the right websites for each environment. Easy!

# General Notes

Always remember to add the websites in your websites' list file! Otherwise nothing
will be downloaded.

Remember you can add as many websites as you like to your environments; the
more websites, the more images!

Do not provide your environment's websites' list with links of websites that
request captcha or other types of control, and neither of websites that display
pop-ups when opened. PuppyAdopter does not know how to close pop-ups nor how
to pass an AI control. Keep it simple!
