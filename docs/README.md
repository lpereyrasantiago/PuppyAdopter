# Puppy Adopter*

Who doesn't love puppies?

# -- What is it? --

A super cool image downloader.

It has never been so easy to create, to manage, to furnish virtual galeries
of images. Of pictures. Of beauty.


# -- How does it work? --

Set your environments and furnish them with images before an eyelid's blink!
Each environment will be automatically filled with images from the websites
you provide to it. Multiple envrionments with different websites will be
populated with different kinds of images! Writers, puppies, landscapes..., never
as easy as today!

Use the Environmentor to create new environments in a fast, inteligente way;
supply your environments with websites with a quick and super-simple method;
run PuppyAdopter and let him fill your environments with images.

# -- Detailed instructions --

Environment Setting:

The Environmentor manages our environments. With it we can create or erase
environments. (The first time that you run Environmentor it will shut down after
apparently doing nothing. This is normal; it is doing useful things. After
this first time, it'll have regular behaviour.)

If we choose to create an environment, we will be prompted to name its folders
and files. We can choose not to name them by simply typing anyting, which will
provide the files and folders with their default names.

Every environment has the following components:

a) an images folder, where the downloaded images of this environment will be stored;
b) a data file, which keeps track of the environment's data, and
c) a websites' list file, which is a simply .txt file where we are to paste the
links of the websites we want our environment to download images from.

The most important file of our environment is the websites' list file, since it
is the one from which PuppyAdopter will retrieve the direction of the websites
he is to download images from. If this file is empty, no images will be
downloaded.

IMPORTANT: it is importante that we paste the links on the websites' list one
per line!

Once we have created our environment with Environmentor and provided its
website's list file with links, we can say our environment is settled! Now
it's time to adopt some puppies! Or download our images, rather...

If we choose to clear our environments, all our environments data will be
erased and PuppyAdopter will no longer recognize the environments we created
before the clearing-process. If you clear your environments, none of them
will work anymore!

Puppy-Adopting Process:

If all your environments were provided with websites on the way explained before,
it's time to download! To do so, simple execute PuppyAdopter. It will automatically
do the job for you. Once it's done, your environments should be furnished with
images from their own websites, now downloaded to your computer!

#-- Quick instructions --

1.1 Run Environmentor. It will shut down the first time; this is normal.
Run it again to create an environment; name the folders and files as
you wish.

1.2 On the step 1.1 you were prompted to name a websites' list: this created a file
with that name. Find the file on your environment and paste in it the
links of the websites you want this environment to download images from. Remember
to paste one link per line!

1.3 Repeat the process until you have as many environments as you want.

2.1 Downloading time! Simply run PuppyAdopter and he will download images from
the right websites for each environment. Easy!

#-- General Notes --

Always remember to add the websites in your websites' list file! Otherwise nothing
will be downloaded.

Remember you can add as many websites as you like to your environments; the
more websites, the more images!
