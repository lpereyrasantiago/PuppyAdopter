### Who doesn't love puppies?

##  What is it?

_**A super cool image downloader.**_

It has never been so easy to create, to manage, to furnish virtual galeries
of images. Of pictures. Of beauty.


## How does it work?

An environment system allows you to create and manage multiple galeries
in a simple, efficient way, and furnish them with infinite pictures before an
eyelid's blink.

Feed your environments with websites' links on their websites' file; run
PuppyAdopter and each environment will download images from their websites.

Feed your environments with as many websitse as you want; create as
many environments as you wish. The sky is the limit!

## Detailed instructions

#### Managing our environments:

You can think of an environment as a galery. It's a place where to download
images from a list of websites you provide. Each environment is independent
from the others, and has its own list of websites.

**Environmentor** _manages our environments_. With it we can create or erase
them.

###### Creating an environment

Run **Envionmentor**. You'll be prompted to erase one or all environments
or create one. Choose to last option; name the files of your environment when
requested to.

Among your environment there is a **websites list** file, which you named
when creating your environment. One per line, paste in the file the links
of the websites this environment will download images from.

Once your environment was created and you provided its **sebsites list** file
with links, we can say your environment is settled.

###### Erasing all environments

When we run **Environmentor** we can also choose to erase all of our environments.
This resets the program to a new-born state: all files, folders and data is
erased permanently. Use it carefully and wiselly.

###### Erasing an environment

**Environmentor** offers us to erase a single environment too. When an environment
is erased, all its files, folders and data are erased permamently.

When this opion is chosen, a list of your environments will be displayed, each
with an index number next to it. Enter the index number of the environment
you wish to erase.

#### Puppy-Adopting Process:

If all your environments were provided with websites on the way explained before,
it's time to feed them! To do so, simple execute PuppyAdopter. It will automatically
do the job for you. Once it's done, your environments should be furnished with
images downloaded from the websites you provided to them into to your computer.

## General Notes

Always remember to add the websites in your websites' list file! Otherwise nothing
will be downloaded.

Remember you can add as many websites as you like to your environments; the
more websites, the more images!

If you erase an environment's folder, this doesn't prevent PuppyAdopter from
considering this environment still exists. The reason is that this environment's
data wasn't properly erased. To properly erase an environment, do not simply delete
its folder: use **Environmentor** to do it.

Do not provide your environment's websites' list with links of websites that
request captcha or other types of control, and neither of websites that display
pop-ups when opened. PuppyAdopter does not know how to close pop-ups nor how
to pass an AI control. Keep it simple!
