Who doesn't love puppies?

# -- What is it? --

What firstly began as a small and silly project -a program that downloaded images of puppies from a default array of websites- has quicly grown into an effective, yet very simple, image downloader.

Puppy Adopter is an automatized, customizable image downloader that works by setting different environments -'galeries' is the usual term- and automatically filling them with images of whatever that environment is designed for. We could, for example, create two environments: philosophers and puppies. After giving each of our environments the websites we would like the program to download images from -to the first environment, websites with pictures of philosophers; to the second, websites with fotographs of puppies-, Puppie Adopter will download philosophers and puppies pictures automatically on runtime, storing them in the right environment. We can have as many environments as we want; we can tell Puppy Adopter to download as many images as we want to, and we can give the program as many websites to download images from for each environment as we wish, so it's easy to imagine how quickly we could have a vast and rich galery of pictures of every kind we want!
