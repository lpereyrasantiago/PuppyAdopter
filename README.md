# PuppyAdopter

--- What is it? ---

  PuppyAdopter is nothing more than a program that downloads images. Its name comes from previous versions -which are still public on this repository-, in which it downloaded only puppies' images from a predetermined web-sites list. Now PuppyAdopter works only through a web-sites list each users gives, which makes its downloads customizable: you could add web-sites holding images of landscapes, animals, philosophers, writers, cars or pretty much anything else, to download images from.  
  
  PuppyAdopter handles information smartly now; it does not download the same image twice and its listdata.txt is a very safe and comfortable way to handle user-given information and make the web-sites list subject of manipulation (which was done in previous versions, though not exactly flawlessly and in a quite uncomfortable way).

  Its only inconvenient is its lack of artificial intelligence at the time of choosing a random image to download from a web-site. Among the hundred of pictures of, let's say, landscapes an X website holds, there might be a few not precisely desired: logos, advertisements or simply an undercover monster-truck photograph no landscapes lover would want. The program does not know how to distinguish them; if in the random selection the chance falls on the monster-truck, or the logo, or any other undesired image, the program will download it anyway.
   
   This problem can be solved through machine learning. This is something I plan to learn and apply to the program. But, as you may see if check how much time there's between each edition of this repository, I don't have the time I need to do so now, since I am learning other computer languages and studying... well, things not related to Python or machine learning.
   
   Apart from this issue, the program is now flawless.
